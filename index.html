          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <hr />
          <p>
            Hello my friend, how are you? Welcome to my love letter to The Last
            Of Us, the main motivation for me to do this website is to declare
            my love for TLOU and show how important these games are to me. For
            those who don't know, The Last Of Us is a game franchise developed
            by
            <a
              href="https://www.naughtydog.com/"
              title="Naughty Dog's website to know more"
              target="_blank"
            >
              Naughty Dog </a
            >, a game studio. The first game came out in
            <time datetime="2014-06-29">29 July 2014</time> for Playstation 3
            and <strong>The Last of Us part II</strong> in 2020 for Playstation
            4. Now in 2022, Naughty Dog released
            <strong>The Last Of Us part I</strong>, a remake from the first game
            from 2014 for Playstation 5. The games tell and show deep and
            involving characters surving in a post pandemic world. Zombies and
            bad people killing each other are pretty standard things in a post
            pandemic world, right? Well, TLOU has all of that, but these're not
            the important parts, what really matters in these games are the
            characters and the story.
          </p>

            I first saw TLOU in Youtube, an Youtuber called
            <a

              >BRKsEDU</a
            >
            that I used to watch made
            <a
              href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLH9fqbYeMD3MNKJDVKYa_rw-r2dnOYFxk"

              target="_blank"
            >
              a series of videos
            </a>
            from the first game and I fell in love with it. Unfortunately at the
            time I didn't have a Playstation, but I guess it was in 2016, I
            bought my Playstation 4 and played TLOU for the first time and oh my
            god, seeing a gameplay it's pretty cool, but actually playing it's a
            all different thing, I understood and loved even more Joel and
            Ellie.

          <hr />
          <p>
            As I said earlier, I played the first TLOU a few years later it was
            released, but that did't make any difference, because I felt the
            impact of that story and world. While I was playing, I cried, I
            laughed and I got really scared at some moments, some of you may
            think that TLOU is not a scary game, but as I'm not used to play
            horror games, TLOU it was <em>a lot to take</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            For me the first game is really cute, I know, I know, a lot of bad
            things happen, but still the journey that Ellie and Joel take
            together is so sweet, both journeys, the geographical and the
            emotional. You can see the evolution of a relationship, bonds being
            created and they taking care of each other on their own way. Below
            you can check out the trailers from the first game. The first video
            is the original story trailer released many years ago. The second
            one is the launch trailer from the
            <strong>remake</strong>.
