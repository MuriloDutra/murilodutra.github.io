          <hr />
          <p>
            Hello my friend, how are you? Welcome to my love letter to The Last
            Of Us, the main motivation for me to do this website is to declare
            my love for TLOU and show how important these games are to me. For
            those who don't know, The Last Of Us is a game franchise developed
            by
            <a
              href="https://www.naughtydog.com/"
              title="Naughty Dog's website to know more"
            >
              Naughty Dog </a
            >, a game studio. The first game came out in
            <time datetime="2014-06-29">29 July 2014</time> for Playstation 3
            and <strong>The Last of Us part II</strong> in 2020 for Playstation
            4. Now in 2022, Naughty Dog released
            <strong>The Last Of Us part I</strong>, a remake from the first game
            from 2014 for Playstation 5. The games tell and show deep and
            involving characters surving in a post pandemic world. Zombies and
            bad people killing each other are pretty standard things in a post
            pandemic world, right? Well, TLOU has all of that, but these're not
            the important parts, what really matters in these games are the
            characters and the story.
          </p>
          <p>
            I first saw TLOU in Youtube, an Youtuber I used to watch made a
            series of videos from the first game and I fell in love with it.
            Unfortunately at the time I didn't have a Playstation, but I guess
            it was in 2016, I bought my Playstation 4 and played TLOU for the
            first time and oh my god, seeing a gameplay it's pretty cool, but
            actually playing it's a all different thing, I understood and loved
            even more Joel and Ellie.
